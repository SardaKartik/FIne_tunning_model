We  will use the [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text out of the box. To improve the inferences, we will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Then you will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics."

        "PEFT is a generic term that includes **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (which is NOT THE SAME as prompt engineering!). In most cases, when someone says PEFT, they typically mean LoRA. LoRA, at a very high level, allows the user to fine-tune their model using fewer compute resources (in some cases, a single GPU). After fine-tuning for a specific task, use case, or tenant with LoRA, the result is that the original LLM remains unchanged and a newly-trained “LoRA adapter” emerges. This LoRA adapter is much, much smaller than the original LLM - on the order of a single-digit % of the original LLM size (MBs vs GBs).  \n",
