# 🚀 Fine-Tuning FLAN-T5 for Dialogue Summarization

This repository demonstrates a two-stage approach to adapting the `google/flan-t5-base` model on the [`knkarthick/dialogsum`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum) dataset.

We start with **prompt engineering techniques** (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning), and then move to **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** to improve performance and reduce compute requirements.

## 🧠 Dataset

We use the **DialogSum** dataset from Hugging Face Datasets:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

huggingface_dataset_name = "knkarthick/dialogsum"
dataset = load_dataset(huggingface_dataset_name)
```

This dataset contains multi-turn dialogues along with human-written summaries.

## 🔍 Phase 1: Prompt Engineering with FLAN-T5

**Model used:** `google/flan-t5-base`

In the first notebook (`notebook_1_prompt_engineering.ipynb`), we explore different prompt-based strategies to summarize dialogues using FLAN-T5:

- **Zero-shot**: Direct inference without examples.
- **One-shot**: Inference with one example.
- **Few-shot**: Inference with 2–3 in-context examples.

FLAN-T5 is a powerful instruction-tuned model, making it ideal for experimenting with prompt engineering without any fine-tuning.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Fine-Tuning with PEFT (LoRA)

In the second notebook (`notebook_2_peft_finetuning.ipynb`), we fine-tune `google/flan-t5-base` using **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** techniques like **LoRA** to reduce the number of trainable parameters while achieving strong performance.

We use Hugging Face's `peft` and `transformers` libraries to implement LoRA adapters.

### ✅ Benefits of PEFT:
- Memory-efficient
- Faster training
- Excellent for deployment on limited hardware

---

## 📊 Evaluation

We evaluate the model using:
- ROUGE scores
- Manual inspection of generated summaries
- Performance comparison: prompt-based vs. fine-tuned

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Add `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- Integrate experiment tracking (e.g., WandB or TensorBoard)
- Try PEFT on larger models like `flan-t5-large`
- Compare with fully fine-tuned baselines
